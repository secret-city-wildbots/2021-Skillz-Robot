> shifter stutter (full stack)
> joystick button switch

> shifter solenoid ports and limit switch ports are wrong (configured for testing)
> LimeLight heights and angles are wrong (still configured for Rogue and not The Child)


> need to tune the LimeLight pipeline latency (servo)
> LimeLight latency with getpipe magically disappeared but could come back
> LimeLight and LIDAR angles and vertical offsets need to be fixed/integrated with servo control
> LimeLight distance to ball calculations


> defensive driving behavior is not intuitive for the driver
