> New odometry code *****

> Swerve LED brightness not working
> bug with the robot booting up into LED party mode

> Lamprey code is currently disconnected because the Lamprey calibrations are failing

> LimeLight heights and angles are wrong (still configured for Rogue and not The Child)
> need to tune the LimeLight pipeline latency (servo)
> LimeLight latency with getpipe magically disappeared but could come back
> LimeLight and LIDAR angles and vertical offsets need to be fixed/integrated with servo control
> LimeLight distance to ball calculations


> defensive driving behavior is not intuitive for the driver
